# Bash Script to Rename Files by Creation Date

This script lists all files in the current directory, sorts them by creation date, and renames them with a numerical prefix.

## Accessing the Script

To access the `createstoryline.sh` script located in the `/workspaces/PrometheusAsDataSource/SymbolicCode/` directory, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script:
    ```bash
    cd /workspaces/PrometheusAsDataSource/SymbolicCode/
    ```
3. Ensure the script has execute permissions:
    ```bash
    chmod +x createstoryline.sh
    ```
4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./createstoryline.sh
    ```
## Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# List all files in the current directory
files=(*)

# Sort files by creation date
sorted_files=($(ls -t --time=creation))

# Initialize counter
counter=1

# Loop through sorted files and rename them
for file in "${sorted_files[@]}"; do
    # Check if it's a file
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        # Extract the filename without the path
        filename=$(basename "$file")
        # Rename the file with the prefix
        mv "$file" "${counter}_$filename"
        # Increment the counter
        ((counter++))
    fi
done
```

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., `rename_files.sh`.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x rename_files.sh`.
3. Run the script in the directory containing the files you want to rename: `./rename_files.sh`.

This will rename all files in the current directory by adding a numerical prefix based on their creation date.
