I have a minikube in openshift cluster anmd i have prometheus and graphana and i am getting 404 error. They are running on minikube and have different loadbalanced urls and there are running on different ports. I get a 404 error. I added the prometheus yalm file that show shows the prometheses to be url and port. What should i try ?

üöÄ It sounds like you have Minikube running an OpenShift cluster with Prometheus and Grafana, and you're encountering a 404 error when accessing these services via their load-balanced URLs. Here are some steps and things you can try to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### 1. **üîç Check Prometheus and Grafana Pod Status**
First, ensure that both Prometheus and Grafana pods are running correctly.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
```

Look for any `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Error`, or `Pending` statuses. If there are issues with the pods themselves, you should check the logs for more details:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

### 2. **üåê Validate Load Balancer URLs**
Ensure the URLs you are trying to access are correct:
- **Prometheus URL**: Try to access it directly using the service name and port, e.g., `http://<prometheus-service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:<port>`.
- **Grafana URL**: Similarly, check the Grafana service URL, e.g., `http://<grafana-service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:<port>`.

If these work internally but not via the load-balanced URLs, the issue might be with the configuration of the load balancer or ingress.

### 3. **‚öôÔ∏è Check Service and Ingress Configuration**
If you are using a LoadBalancer service or an Ingress, inspect the configuration of these resources.

#### Check Services:
```bash
kubectl get svc -n <namespace>
kubectl describe svc <prometheus-service-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl describe svc <grafana-service-name> -n <namespace>
```
- Ensure that the services are exposing the correct ports.
- Look at the `type` of the service. If it's `ClusterIP`, make sure you have an Ingress configured to expose the service externally.

#### Check Ingress:
```bash
kubectl get ingress -n <namespace>
kubectl describe ingress <ingress-name> -n <namespace>
```
- Ensure the Ingress is pointing to the correct services and ports.
- Confirm that the paths in your Ingress are correctly configured to route traffic to Prometheus and Grafana.

### 4. **üåê Networking Issues**
If you're using Minikube, networking can sometimes be tricky. You may want to check the Minikube ingress controller:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ingress
```

You should see the `ingress-controller` running. If not, you might need to enable the ingress addon:

```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

### 5. **üìù Check Prometheus Configuration (YAML)**
Since you've mentioned that you've added a YAML file for Prometheus, check that the configuration in the file properly references the service URL and port. Verify that:
- The scrape configuration is correct (if you're scraping Grafana or other targets).
- The correct port is specified in both Prometheus and Grafana YAML files.

### 6. **üìä Grafana Dashboards Configuration**
Make sure Grafana is configured to query Prometheus correctly:
1. Login to Grafana.
2. Go to `Configuration` > `Data Sources`.
3. Check the URL in the Prometheus data source configuration to ensure it matches the service URL and port of Prometheus.

### 7. **üìú Logs for More Information**
Check the logs for both Prometheus and Grafana services to see if they provide any more clues about the 404 error:

```bash
kubectl logs <prometheus-pod-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs <grafana-pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

### 8. **üîå Minikube Tunnel**
If you're using `LoadBalancer` type services, Minikube requires you to run a `minikube tunnel` to expose the services externally:

```bash
minikube tunnel
```

This creates a network tunnel to expose LoadBalancer services, which might resolve the issue with accessing them.

By following these steps, you should be able to pinpoint where the 404 error is coming from and correct any misconfigurations in your OpenShift Minikube environment.
