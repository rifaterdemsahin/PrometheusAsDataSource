To resolve the issue of accessing the Prometheus server in Minikube, here's a breakdown of the steps you can take based on the service configuration you mentioned:

### Problem Overview:
Your `prometheus-server` is currently exposed as a `ClusterIP` service, which means it can only be accessed from within the Kubernetes cluster. If you're encountering an `i/o timeout`, it's likely because you're trying to access Prometheus from outside the cluster.

### Solutions:

#### 1. **Port Forwarding (Recommended for Local Development)**
This method allows you to access Prometheus directly from your local machine without changing the service type.

**Steps:**
- Run the following command to forward the Prometheus service's port to your local machine:

  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:80
  ```

- Once done, you can access Prometheus on your local machine using:

  ```
  http://localhost:9090
  ```

This method is quick and works well if you're running Minikube locally or if you don't want to modify your cluster's service.

#### 2. **Change Service Type to `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`**
If you want to expose Prometheus outside of the cluster permanently:

**a. Change to `NodePort` (For Access Outside the Cluster)**

- Edit the Prometheus service definition and change the service type to `NodePort`:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
      - name: http
        port: 80
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 9090
        nodePort: 30090  # You can specify a port in the NodePort range (30000-32767)
  ```

- After updating, you'll be able to access Prometheus via:

  ```
  http://<minikube-ip>:30090
  ```

  You can get the Minikube IP by running:

  ```bash
  minikube ip
  ```

**b. Change to `LoadBalancer` (Only if Using Cloud Providers)**
- If you're running Minikube in a cloud environment (or with a LoadBalancer addon), you can change the service type to `LoadBalancer`:

  ```yaml
  spec:
    type: LoadBalancer
  ```

  This will expose Prometheus via an external IP that is assigned by the cloud provider.

#### 3. **Network Diagnostics (If Both Grafana and Prometheus Are Inside the Cluster)**

If both Grafana and Prometheus are running inside the cluster, but you still get `i/o timeout` errors, there might be network policies or misconfigurations. You can check connectivity by running this from the Grafana pod:

```bash
kubectl exec -it <grafana-pod-name> -- curl http://10.107.155.133:80
```

If this command fails, it could indicate a network issue, or that there is some firewall or misconfiguration blocking the traffic between the services.

### Recap:
- For local access, `kubectl port-forward` is the easiest and quickest option.
- For permanent external access, change the service type to `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.
- Use network diagnostics if Grafana and Prometheus are both inside the cluster and still face communication issues.
