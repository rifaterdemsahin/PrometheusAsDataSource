If you're looking for a Prometheus query that is highly adaptable and can work in any environment, the following example is a good starting point. This query will return all metrics for any instance, matching any labels:

```promql
up{job=~".*", instance=~".*"}
```

### Explanation:
- `up` is a built-in metric that indicates if a target is up (1) or down (0).
- `{job=~".*", instance=~".*"}` ensures that it matches any job or instance, similar to a wildcard.

This query will return the status of all instances and jobs being monitored by Prometheus, regardless of the environment. The `up` metric works universally as long as there are active targets in Prometheus.

If you want to search for other metrics in a similarly universal manner, you can replace `up` with the desired metric name, keeping the wildcard-style label selectors:

```promql
metric_name{label1=~".*", label2=~".*"}
```

This query structure will work in any Prometheus setup as long as the metric exists.
