In Kubernetes, we use *services* to reliably expose and manage access to a group of pods, enabling consistent communication within a dynamic environment where pods are frequently created, destroyed, or scaled. Specifically, services in Kubernetes:

1. **Provide Stable Networking**: Services give pods a consistent endpoint (IP address and DNS name), allowing other components to reliably access them even as pod IPs change.

2. **Enable Load Balancing**: Services distribute incoming traffic across multiple pods, balancing the load and improving application performance and reliability.

3. **Facilitate Service Discovery**: By grouping pods that perform the same function, services make it easier for applications to discover and communicate with each other.

4. **Support Scalability**: Services abstract away individual pods, making it possible to scale applications up or down seamlessly.

Using services ensures that applications in Kubernetes are highly available, scalable, and resilient to pod changes, which is key for reliable operation in production environments.
