***********************************************************************************************

Prometheus url in code space https://friendly-rotary-phone-7w5g6j49r6hwr4p-9090.app.github.dev/graph?g0.expr=&g0.tab=1&g0.display_mode=lines&g0.show_exemplars=0&g0.range_input=1h
### Why can't I add this URL to Grafana as a data source?

**URL:** `https://studious-trout-j97xvpwj66c5w7x-9090.app.github.dev/graph?g0.expr=&g0.tab=1&g0.display_mode=lines&g0.show_exemplars=0&g0.range_input=1h`

#### Answer:
The URL provided is for accessing the Prometheus web UI and not the API endpoint required by Grafana. Grafana needs the base URL of the Prometheus server's API endpoint to function correctly.

To add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana, use the following URL instead:

**Correct URL:** `https://studious-trout-j97xvpwj66c5w7x-9090.app.github.dev`

Follow these steps to configure the data source in Grafana:
1. Open Grafana and navigate to **Configuration** > **Data Sources**.
2. Click **Add data source** and select **Prometheus**.
3. In the **URL** field, enter the correct URL: `https://studious-trout-j97xvpwj66c5w7x-9090.app.github.dev`.
4. Configure any additional settings as needed (e.g., authentication).
5. Click **Save & Test** to verify the connection.

By using the correct URL, you should be able to successfully add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.

401 Unauthorized - There was an error returned querying the Prometheus API.


#### Troubleshooting Steps:
1. **Check Authentication:** Ensure that the Prometheus server requires authentication and that you have provided the correct credentials in Grafana.
    - Go to **Configuration** > **Data Sources** in Grafana.
    - Select your Prometheus data source.
    - Under **Auth**, configure the necessary authentication details (e.g., Basic Auth, API Key).

2. **Verify Prometheus Configuration:** Confirm that the Prometheus server is configured to allow connections from Grafana.
    - Check the Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) for any access control settings.
    - Ensure that the Prometheus server is running and accessible from the network where Grafana is hosted.

3. **Network Issues:** Ensure there are no network issues or firewalls blocking the connection between Grafana and Prometheus.
    - Try accessing the Prometheus URL directly from the Grafana server's command line using `curl` or `wget`.

4. **Check Logs:** Review the logs for both Grafana and Prometheus for any error messages that might provide more details.
    - Grafana logs can be found in the Grafana installation directory or via the Grafana web UI under **Server Admin** > **Logs**.
    - Prometheus logs can be found in the Prometheus installation directory or configured log file.

5. **Update Grafana and Prometheus:** Ensure you are using compatible versions of Grafana and Prometheus. Sometimes, version mismatches can cause issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the `401 Unauthorized` error when adding Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
