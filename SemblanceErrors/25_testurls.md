It seems like you're facing two distinct issues with your Prometheus setup: a **401 Unauthorized error** when using the load-balanced URL and an **i/o timeout** error when accessing the Prometheus ClusterIP.

### Troubleshooting Both Issues:

#### 1. **401 Unauthorized Error on Load-Balanced URL**

The `401 Unauthorized` error indicates that authentication is required when trying to access the Prometheus API via the load-balanced URL. Prometheus itself does not enforce authentication by default, but if you have a reverse proxy or some kind of ingress setup (like GitHub Codespaces or OAuth integration), it could be enforcing authentication.

**Potential Fixes:**

- **Check if authentication is enabled** in the reverse proxy or ingress controller. If so, make sure that Grafana is using the correct credentials (usually in the `Basic Auth` or `Bearer Token` section when configuring the Prometheus data source).
- If you're using OAuth or a similar method for authentication, ensure that you have configured it in Grafana’s Prometheus data source settings.
- You might need to pass additional headers to authenticate Grafana to access Prometheus via the load-balanced URL.

#### 2. **i/o Timeout Error on ClusterIP**

The `i/o timeout` error suggests that Grafana cannot reach the Prometheus server via the ClusterIP. This is typically caused by network connectivity issues or incorrect service configurations.

**Potential Fixes:**

- **Check Grafana's location**:
  - If Grafana is running **outside** the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., locally or in another cloud environment), it will not be able to access the `ClusterIP` service because `ClusterIP` services are only accessible within the cluster network. In this case, use port forwarding:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:9090
    ```

    Then, set the Prometheus URL in Grafana to `http://localhost:9090`.

- **Check Grafana and Prometheus networking**:
  - If both Grafana and Prometheus are running inside the Kubernetes cluster, ensure that there are no network policies or firewall rules blocking traffic between the Grafana pod and the Prometheus service.
  - Run this command to check if Grafana can reach Prometheus from within the cluster:

  @rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/PrometheusAsDataSource (main) $ kubectl get pods

@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/PrometheusAsDataSource (main) $ ^C
@rifaterdemsahin ➜ /workspaces/PrometheusAsDataSource (main) $ 

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it grafana-5d6687f55f-wbkr6 -- curl http://10.107.155.133:9090
    ```

    If this fails, it could indicate network issues or service misconfiguration.

- **Check Prometheus service type**:
  - Ensure that Prometheus is exposed via a `ClusterIP` service if Grafana is in the same cluster, or through a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service if Grafana is outside the cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc prometheus-server -o yaml
    ```

    You should see something like this for a `ClusterIP`:

    ```yaml
    spec:
      type: ClusterIP
      ports:
      - port: 9090
        targetPort: 9090
        protocol: TCP
      clusterIP: 10.107.155.133
    ```

#### **Combining the Fixes**:

1. **For the Load-Balanced URL**: Ensure authentication is properly set up and configured in Grafana’s Prometheus data source settings.
2. **For the ClusterIP Timeout**: Ensure Grafana and Prometheus are in the same network, or use port-forwarding if accessing Prometheus from outside the cluster.
